                <p>The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001. The band's founding members are Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (guitar, vocals). Later, Mark Stoermer (bass, vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) officially joined the lineup. The band's name is derived from a fictional band in the New Order music video for "Crystal."</p><p>Brandon Flowers, having been kicked out of his first band, began searching for a guitarist to realize his musical ambitions. He found Dave Keuning through an ad Keuning had placed in a local newspaper. The duo quickly bonded over their shared musical tastes, which included British bands such as New Order, The Cure, Oasis, and The Smiths. Their early rehearsals consisted of Flowers' lyrics set to Keuning's guitar riffs, leading to the creation of some of their earliest songs.</p><p>The Killers started playing in small clubs and venues in Las Vegas, gradually building a local following. Their breakthrough came in 2003 when a demo tape was played on a BBC Radio 1 show in the UK. This exposure led to a record deal with Lizard King Records in the UK, and subsequently with Island Def Jam Music Group in the United States.</p><p>The band's debut album, "Hot Fuss," released in 2004, was a massive success, spawning hit singles like "Mr. Brightside," "Somebody Told Me," "All These Things That I've Done," and "Smile Like You Mean It." The album's blend of new wave, post-punk revival, and alternative rock resonated with a wide audience, establishing The Killers as a major force in the music industry. "Hot Fuss" achieved multi-platinum status in several countries and solidified their international presence.</p><p>Following the success of "Hot Fuss," The Killers released their second album, "Sam's Town," in 2006. This album showcased a more mature and Americana-inspired sound, drawing influences from artists like Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty. "Sam's Town" generated hits like "When You Were Young" and "Bones" and continued the band's streak of commercial success.</p><p>In 2008, The Killers released "Day & Age," an album that blended art rock with synth-pop and glam rock elements. The album featured the hit single "Human," which became another chart-topper for the band. "Battle Born" followed in 2012, showcasing a more stadium-rock oriented sound. "Wonderful Wonderful" came out in 2017 and "Imploding the Mirage" in 2020, both marking further evolution in their sound while maintaining their signature style.</p><p>The Killers have consistently toured extensively, performing at major festivals and venues around the world. Their live performances are known for their energy, showmanship, and Brandon Flowers' charismatic stage presence. The band has received numerous awards and accolades throughout their career, including Brit Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, and NME Awards. Their enduring popularity and influence on contemporary rock music are a testament to their talent, creativity, and ability to connect with audiences on a deep level.</p><p>The Killers' musical style is characterized by its blend of new wave, post-punk revival, and alternative rock influences, creating a unique and recognizable sound. Brandon Flowers' distinctive vocals, Dave Keuning's melodic guitar riffs, Mark Stoermer's driving basslines, and Ronnie Vannucci Jr.'s energetic drumming contribute to the band's signature sound. They often incorporate synth elements and electronic textures into their music, adding a modern edge to their classic rock influences. Their music explores themes of love, loss, ambition, and the American experience.</p>
